<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The COVID Racial Data Tracker is a volunteer organization launched from The Atlantic and was created in collaboration between the COVID Tracking Project and the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, we are quickly learning about the disparity between race and COVID-19 cases. I am using this project to explore AIAN COVID rates by state to understand where the highest disparities lie in both frequency and proximity. The questions I will be exploring in this project are (1) how do AIAN COVID-19 rates/deaths compare between states, (2) which states reported the highest AIAN COVID cases in the US, and (3) which states reported the highest AIAN COVID deaths in the US?</p>

<h1>AIAN Covid-19 Cases by State</h1>
<p>This figure represents all reported American Indian and Alaska Native Covid-19 cases in the US by state* and DC. As of October 4th, the 3 highest reported AIAN cases are from Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>*All states are reported except Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania ,and Texas–these states reported N/A for AIAN Covid cases for all dates reported. (Non-reports are most likely due to racial misclassification.)</p>

<h1>Heat Maps</h1>
<p>These heat maps show AIAN Covid-19 cases and deaths over time by state. The reported numbers are cumulative by date. Although Oklahoma did not report a higher number of AIAN cases in the beginning of the pandemic, this heat map shows cases increased around August. AIAN cases were generally higher throughout the pandemic for Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Upon initial inspection of the reported AIAN Covid-19 deaths, Illinois reported 512 AIAN which was most likely a misreporting. The corrected heat map is displayed without the outlier. Although Oklahoma had the 3rd highest reported AIAN Covid-19 cases, the deaths reported were minimal. Arizona and New Mexico reported higher AIAN deaths due to Covid than any other state. <br></p>

<h1>Maps</h1>
<p>Maps show geographic proximity of reported cases by state. This can be an important indicator given each state’s AIAN population has a different rural versus urban population. In addition, resources for AIAN communities and tribes vary by state. An important piece to note is Michigan’s initially reported 512 AIAN cases. This disparity was not detectable in the other graphs produced. However, by October 4th, we can see the disparity in cases in among Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The disparity of AIAN deaths due to Covid-19 were highest in Arizona and New Mexico. Although Oklahoma reported higher AIAN cases initially, those cases did not translate into higher AIAN deaths.</p>
