Covid-19 Cases among American Indian and Alaska Natives by State

This report shows uses the COVID Racial Data Tracker. This tracker was launched from The Atlantic and was created in collaboration between the COVID Tracking Project and the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. The questions explored in this project are (1) how do AIAN COVID-19 rates/deaths compare between states, (2) which states reported the highest AIAN COVID cases in the US, and (3) which states reported the highest AIAN COVID deaths in the US?

The dataset was acquired through The COVID Tracking Projectâ€™s website https://covidtracking.com/race. Data can be access here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR_xmYt4ACPDZCDJcY12kCiMiH0ODyx3E1ZvgOHB8ae1tRcjXbs_yWBOA4j4uoCEADVfC1PS2jYO68B/pub?gid=43720681&single=true&output=csv. Although an API version of the dataset was advertised on the website, the race related data was only available as a .csv file.
